# IQ_link
This is a java implementation of a board game IQ link (https://www.smartgames.eu/uk/one-player-games/iq-link)

This java program was implemented by Tom Xu, Isaac Chen and Russell Ye in 2016. The tests in the project were written by Professor Steve Blackburn of ANU. 

Note that this was one solution for an assignment of a ANU course COMP1110 in 2016, so any forms of copying for assignment submission are not allowed.
